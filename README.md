### Note 

On my github profile, there are many repositories created. Some of them are single file shell scripts, whereas some are older projects which I made years ago, also there are some testing repositories either made for testing other scripts or storing docs of learning courses, or practice projects made for collaboration. So, in this crowd, how can someone find useful repositories that may be beneficial to you, and also they are regularly being updated by me. Not all the repositories (projects) are blessed with my updates, only a few are regularly updated and bugs are fixed. They are listed below :
* [Encrypted Diary Management](https://github.com/rdofficial/EncryptedDiaryManagement)
* [GIT Commits Bomber](https://github.com/rdofficial/git-commits-bomber)
* [Anonymous HTML Hoster](https://github.com/rdofficial/NodeJsAnonHtmlHoster)

For the other repositories that are useful to many people, but there are no further updates and even there are bugs in it. People can either create an issue or inform me through an email to rdofficial192@gmail.com. If you can fix the code yourself, and also can update the features of the project, then you are allowed to do it. Just create a pull request, or send me the updated code at my email : _rdofficial192@gmail.com_.
